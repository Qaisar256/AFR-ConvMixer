# AFR-ConvMixer
We start by defining key parameters, including three ConvMixer blocks for robust feature extraction and five iterations in the AdaBoost algorithm for precision enhancement. Leveraging pre-trained CNN models like ResNet-50, Inception-v3, and DenseNet-161, we tap into their learned features to aid in identifying facial attributes.
